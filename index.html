            Introduction :-
        </b>
        <br>
        Solar sails, also known as photons sail, are a method of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight on large surfaces.
        <br><br>
        <b>
            History :-
        </b>
        <br>
        In 1864  James Clerk Maxwell published the theory of electromagnetic fields  and radiation. Maxwell’s Equation  provide the theoretical foundation for sailing with light pressure. The first formal technology and design effort for a solar sail began in 1976 at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
        <br><br>
        <b>
            Basic Idea :-
        </b>
        <br>
        A solar sail is a method of propelling a spacecraft through space using sunlight. The sails are made of lightweight, reflective material that is 40 to 100 times thinner than a piece of writing paper. 
        The sails capture the momentum of light from the Sun and use that momentum to push the spacecraft forward.
        <i>
            The most common material in current designs is a thin layer of aluminum coating on a polymer (plastic) sheet, such as aluminized 2 µm Kapton film.

            Advantages & Uses:-
        </b>
        <br>
        It is helpful in faster travel in space to reduce time of travelling. They allow spacecraft to be made much lighter and carry larger payloads.
        So the fastest rocket we have built till date can only reach speeds upto 163km/s or 0.05% the speed of light. With this new type of spacecrafts we can reach top speeds of 32600km/s or 10% the speed of light.
        <br><br>
        <b>
        Disadvantages & Difficulties :-
        </b>
        <br>
        But there are many disadvantages like Solar sails cannot be used in the shadows of planets or moons, Solar sails need to be very large and very light, which makes them difficult to deploy.
        <br><br>
        <b>
            Examples :-
        </b>
        <br>
        The most common example of solar sail spacecraft is IKAROS launched in 2010 by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency or JAXA. It was also the first solar sail spacecraft.
        <i>
            This concept was used partially in Misson Mangal.
